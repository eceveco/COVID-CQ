# Twitter Stance Dataset

We report on the preparation of a stance data set, called COVID-CQ, for user-generated content on Twitter in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, we investigated more than 14 thousands tweets and annotated the opinions of the tweet initiators regarding the use of "Chloroquine" and "Hydroxychloroquine" for the treatment or prevention from the coronavirus.
