## COVID-CQ

# Twitter Stance Dataset

We report on the preparation of a stance data set, called COVID-CQ, for user-generated content on Twitter in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, we investigated more than 14 thousand tweets and annotated the opinions of the tweet initiators regarding the use of "Chloroquine" and "Hydroxychloroquine" for the treatment or prevention from the coronavirus.

In our annotation procedure, each annotator was asked to annotate the individual tweets as "Against","Favor" or "Neutral/None" for the unproven claim of "Cxhloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is cure for the novel coronavirus".
